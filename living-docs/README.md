# PTBL Living Docs

Last updated: 2026-01-24

Scope: This repository stores the living Markdown docs that preserve context for humans and LLMs. It does NOT contain the validator code itself unless you choose to co-locate it later.

## If you only read one thing
- Start here: docs/01_ROUTING_GUIDE.md
- All living docs live in docs/ (flat). Root is for README, CHANGELOG, TASKS only.
- Every doc starts with the standard header block and an append-only Update log.
- Edit docs in small commits. Keep links stable.

## Update log
- 2026-01-24: Created skeleton.


## Repo map
- docs/: living docs
- exports/docx/: original DOCX sources (kept for reference)
- templates/: copy-paste templates and helper scripts


## Conventions
- File names are numbered for stable navigation.
- Use relative links.
- Avoid huge single files. Prefer a short front door plus linked specs.
