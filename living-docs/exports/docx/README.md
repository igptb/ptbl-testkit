# DOCX exports

Last updated: 2026-01-24

Scope: Store source DOCX files here as reference exports. Markdown in docs/ is the living canonical source.

## If you only read one thing
- Keep original DOCX exports here for auditing and easy sharing.
- Do not edit DOCX as the primary workflow. Edit Markdown in docs/.
- When you update a DOCX export, update the matching Markdown doc Update log.

## Update log
- 2026-01-24: Created skeleton.
