# PTBL TestKit v3.6: Phased Execution Order

Last updated: 2026-01-24

Scope: Execution plan for TestKit work. Detailed contracts live in linked docs.

## If you only read one thing
- This is the front door execution plan for TestKit work.
- Validation has three tiers: schema, semantic, policy.
- Keep phases and completion gates here, define contracts in linked docs.
- This file should stay short and link outward.
